Haskma is an implementation of an Enigma

you can compile it with: ghc --make

When started you can type in a message and it returns the encrypted
message. To decrypt it you have to type the encrypted message in to
the program. Rotors are provided in the code. If you want to add more
you have to add them to "rots" which is a list of rotors.
